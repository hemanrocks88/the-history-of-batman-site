            <h2>The History of Batman</h2>
            <p>Batman, also known as the Dark Knight, made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 in May 1939. Created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, Batman's origin story features him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne, as a child. This vendetta is tempered by the ideal of justice. He trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors the Gotham streets at night. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}</p>

            <p>Over the decades, Batman has evolved through various interpretations in comics, television, and film. From the campy 1960s TV series starring Adam West to the darker portrayals in graphic novels and movies, Batman remains a symbol of justice and resilience. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}</p>
